# CRSF Protocol Java Library

A Java library for implementing the Crossfire (CRSF) protocol, designed for reliable and low-latency communication in remote control systems. The CRSF protocol is commonly used in radio control systems for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other remote-controlled devices, providing fast and secure data transmission.

## Features

- **Crossfire (CRSF) Protocol Support**: Implements core functionalities for sending and receiving CRSF messages.
- **Low-latency Communication**: Optimized for real-time data transmission with minimal delay.
- **Reliable Data Transfer**: Supports error detection and recovery mechanisms for stable communication.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Java applications and custom projects.
- **Configurable Packet Handling**: Allows custom processing of incoming and outgoing packets.
